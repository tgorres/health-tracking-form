# health-tracking-form
This project is a simple html form for practicing various form input elements and linking a css stylesheet. It was created for the "Build Something of Your Choice" Assignment in week 2 of Moddule 1 of the Code:You Web Development Pathway.
The idea behind this project was to build a form for tracking personal health information like weight and blood pressure.
